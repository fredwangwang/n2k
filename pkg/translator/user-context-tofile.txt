Here is an example:

Source template:
```
{{ with secret "control-plane-services/data/kafka-cert" }}
{{ .Data.data.auth.ca_cert_intermediate }}
{{ .Data.data.auth.ca_cert }}
{{ end }}
```

Destination:
```
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1beta1
kind: VaultStaticSecret
metadata:
  name: secret
spec:
  type: kv-v2 # fixed
  mount: control-plane-services
  path: kafka-cert

  destination:
    name: secretkv # fixed
    create: true # fixed
    transformation:
      excludes: [".*"] # fixed
      templates:
        # templates has only one entry named `content`
        # the `text` filed of `content` is the info within secret block in the source template,
        # with ".Data.data.<key>" changed to ".Secrets.<key>" 
        content:
          text: |
            {{ .Secrets.auth.ca_cert_intermediate }}
            {{ .Secrets.auth.ca_cert }}
```
